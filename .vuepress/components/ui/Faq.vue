                                    In both cases, if you choose a Capped supply you won't be able to mint more tokens
                                    than the defined cap. By choosing Unlimited supply instead, you will be able to
                                    generate unlimited tokens.

                                    There is no way to execute code after a ERC-20 transfer or approval (i.e. making a
                                    payment), so to make an action it is required to send another transaction and pay
                                    GAS twice. ERC1363 makes token payments easier and working without the use of any
                                    other listener. It allows to make a callback after a transfer or approval in a
                                    single transaction.<br>
                                    There are many proposed uses of Ethereum Smart Contracts that can accept ERC-20

                                    There are lots of tokens lost forever into Smart Contracts. Each Ethereum contract
                                    is a potential token trap for ERC20 tokens. They can't be recovered so it means
                                    money losses for end users.<br>
                                    TokenRecover allows the contract owner to recover any ERC20 token sent into the
                                    contract for error.

                                    Once you confirm your transaction you will receive transaction hash (first) and
                                    Token address (when transaction is confirmed). If your transaction will take some
                                    time to be confirmed due to network status, you can monitor it and your Token will
                                    be visible in transaction page. Watch the above video tutorial for details.

                                    To generate new tokens you must use the "mint" function using token owner wallet.
                                    You can doing this by using the Contract/Write tab on your Etherscan token page.
                                    You can also import ABI from the Docs page in tools like MyEtherWallet and calling
                                    the mint function.<br>
                                    <small>
                                        Note: remember that your tokens has a number of decimals (usually 18), so you
                                        must use the entire number with decimals.<br>I.e. if you need to generate 500
                                        additional tokens, call the mint function by inserting 500000000000000000000.

                                    No, your Token is not SCAM. Code is well tested and updated regularly, token has
                                    verified source code already used by thousands of tokens. It will be SCAM if you
                                    use as it. ERC20 Token Generator is FREE to use and there are about 10.000 tokens
                                    built on. Maybe someone used it to SCAM but it doesn't mean you will use for it too.

                                    Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs Smart Contracts: applications
                                    that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship,
                                    fraud or third-party interference.<br>
                                    These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared
                                    global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of
                                    property.<br>
                                    This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or
                                    promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past
                                    (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been
                                    invented yet, all without a middleman or counterparty risk.

                                    DApp is an abbreviated form for decentralized application.<br>
                                    A DApp has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network.
                                    Contrast this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized
                                    servers.<br>
                                    A DApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just
                                    like an app) that can make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can
                                    be hosted on decentralized storage such as Swarm or IPFS.<br>
                                    For an application to be considered a Dapp (pronounced Dee-app, similar to
                                    Email) it must meet the following criteria:

                                        The application must be completely open-source, it must operate
                                        autonomously, and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens. The
                                        application may adapt its protocol in response to proposed improvements and
                                        market feedback but all changes must be decided by consensus of its users.

                                        The application's data and records of operation must be cryptographically
                                        stored in a public, decentralized blockchain in order to avoid any central
                                        points of failure.

                                        The application must use a cryptographic token (bitcoin or a token native to
                                        its system) which is necessary for access to the application and any

                                    "Gas" is the name for a special unit used in Ethereum. It measures how much
                                    "work" an action or set of actions takes to perform.<br>
                                    Every operation that can be performed by a transaction or contract on the
                                    Ethereum platform costs a certain number of gas, with operations that require
                                    more computational resources costing more gas than operations that require few
